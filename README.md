### 2.5 : [Concept 3] # Cloud Deployments 101: Docker → CI/CD → AWS/Azure

## Question
How do Docker and CI/CD pipelines simplify deployment workflows, and what considerations are important when deploying a full-stack application securely to AWS or Azure?

---

## 1. How Docker Simplifies Deployment Workflows

Docker packages an application and all its dependencies into a single, portable container image. This guarantees that the application runs the same in development, CI, and production.

In our project, the Next.js application is containerized using a Dockerfile. PostgreSQL and Redis run as separate containers during development using Docker Compose. The same Docker image is deployed to AWS/Azure.

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates “works on my machine” issues  
- Ensures environment consistency  
- Makes deployments portable and repeatable  

Docker stabilizes **what** we deploy.

---

## 2. How CI/CD Pipelines Simplify Deployment

CI/CD pipelines automate build, test, and deploy steps. Every code commit follows the same path.

Using GitHub Actions, our pipeline:
1. Triggers on push  
2. Runs checks  
3. Builds a Docker image  
4. Applies migrations  
5. Deploys to AWS/Azure  

**Benefits:**
- Fewer human errors  
- Predictable releases  
- Faster feedback  

CI/CD stabilizes **how** we deploy.

## 3. Secure Deployment Considerations (AWS / Azure)

### Secrets Management
- No secrets in code or images  
- Use AWS Secrets Manager / Azure Key Vault  
- Inject at runtime  

### Environment Separation
- Dev ≠ Prod  
- Separate configs and credentials  

### Network Security
- DB/Redis private  
- App public  

### Access Control
- IAM roles / Managed identities  
- No hardcoded credentials  

---

## 4. Case Study: The Never-Ending Deployment Loop

**Chain of Trust**
Code Commit → Docker Image → CI/CD → Cloud Deployment → Runtime Environment

### Issues
- **Env var not found:** secrets not injected/validated  
- **Port already in use:** old containers not stopped  
- **Old container running:** no versioning/cleanup  

---

## 5. Fix with Proper Docker & CI/CD

### Containerization
- Versioned Docker images  
- No secrets baked in  

### Pipeline
1. Validate env vars  
2. Stop/remove old container  
3. Deploy new version  
4. Health check  
5. Rollback on failure  

Restores the chain of trust.

---

## Conclusion
Docker ensures consistency of artifacts; CI/CD ensures consistency of delivery. Secure configuration and clean handoffs prevent deployment loops.
